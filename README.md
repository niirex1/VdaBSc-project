## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of VdaBSc, a novel model for smart contract vulnerability detection. The model incorporates dynamic analysis, real-time runtime batch normalization, data augmentation, N-grams, and a hybrid architecture combining BiLSTM, CNN, and the Attention Mechanism. The proposed model has been rigorously evaluated against existing methods and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, demonstrating superior performance across key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score.
